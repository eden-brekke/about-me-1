I'm a community organizer and love to assist BIPOC in the Seattle area with getting more connected to our communities here. I have a small business making ceramics and I turned my "dining room" into a tiny ceramics studio. One of my most loved activites giving my friends mini ceramic lessons!
    Fun fact: I taught my dog Raven how to talk with buttons! :)</h2>
