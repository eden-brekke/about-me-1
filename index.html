    <h2>Biography: I was born and raised in Bellingham, Wa and moved to the Seattle over 4 years ago. I'm a community organizer and love to assist BIPOC in the Seattle area with getting more connected to our communities here. I have a small business making ceramics and I turned my "dining room" into a tiny ceramics studio. One of my most loved activites giving my friends mini ceramic lessons!
    Fun fact: I taught my dog Raven how to talk with buttons! :)</h2>
    <h2>Education: During high school I attended a National Guard Bootcamp for 6 months, then came back home and graduted high school. I started attending Everett Community College in fall of 2020 and am currently a student. Now I'm a full time student at CodeFellows and will be graduating in June 2022. </h2>
    <h2>Employment: My employment background includes a wide variety of fields including non-profit, healthcare, retail, food servic, and domestic and wildlife rescue/rehabilitation.</h2>
    <h2>Goals: One of my biggest goals is getting my PADI diving license so I can open water dive with whales, sharks, and branch my wildlife rehab background to. I'm working towards building a sustainable mini farm with treehouses and tiny homes. Despite my fear of heights, I'm determined to be a high-altitude slackliner.</h2>
